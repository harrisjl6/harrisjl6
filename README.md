ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harrisjl6


ðŸ‘€ I've been working as a front end developer for more than 18 years. 

I spent 12 years in the United States Air Force and then another 14 years working for NASA at Johnson Space Center in Houston.  
I am currently working as a senior Designer/Developer for NTTdata's Experience Build Team.  You can see samples of my work at bluelinedesign.org/gallery
